- It is taken for granted nowadays that improving technology is connected to reducing privacy, see Google Now, etc.
- I myself do also use a lot of services where I know that my data is collected and monetized. Are there alternatives? Sometimes you cannot choose, sometimes it's convenience.
- Language technologies play a major part in this: everytime your enter text or speech on a mobile phone this data instantly belongs to a company (not to speak of all those secret agencies...)

- But language technologies can be used to improve privacy, see idibon.
- Open Source can help, to empower people to control their privacy.
- I think it's a myth that better technology is necessarily connected to giving up privacy. Don't let those companies that collect data tell you how technology works: having more or less privacy has nothing to do with technological development, only with business models.

- Poio does not and will not collect or share personal information.
- Support Open Source. Support Open Source Language Technologies.
