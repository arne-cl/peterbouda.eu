I originally started this blog to share my, ähem, wisdom, about Maemo,
MeeGo and Qt programming in general. As it turned out MeeGo died an
unpleasant death and was replaced by Windows Phone and some OS with a
strange name. Now I was looking for a new blogging plattform that might
be easier to maintain than this self-developed patchwork you are
watching. So I decided to start a new blog, with new technology and new
URL. One of the main topics will definitely Firefox OS, there must be a
way to have an open operating system on mobile phones! This here will
stay as a museum. Head over to:
